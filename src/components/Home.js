        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p> I am a fullstack engineer focused on learning.</p>
        <p>
          I like frontend design, working with clients and users, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a passion for learning, which is why I recently completed the
          elearnSecurity Junior Pentester certification.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's also why I will soon be starting the elearnSecurity Certified
          Professional Penetration Tester and the Offensive Security Certified
          Professional certifications.

        <p> For my next role, I am hoping to find somewhere to grow.</p>
        <p>
          My highest priority is to find work where I can contribute
          meaningfully to your company and my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very early in my career and so I am open to wide variety of paths
          to the same end goal.
